# Rod Cutting Problem

**Problem Statement:**
Given a rod of length `n` and an array of prices that contains prices of all pieces of size smaller than `n`.  
Determine the maximum total value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.

**Example:**
Input:  
n = 8  
prices = {1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20}

Output:  
22

**Explanation:**  
Cut the rod into two pieces of length 2 and 6, which gives:  
price[2] + price[6] = 5 + 17 = 22
